Created using Jupyter Notebook
In our senior project, we aimed to develop a Python-based simulator for to model CO2 injection wells. 
We created code to interpolate viscosity, density, and specific heat using pressure and temperature readings from the PERTT Lab outputted into an Excel matrix. 
Then we used fundamental conservation equations to model flow behavior. 
We compared our simulator with the commercial software OLGA and drew off of published simulation literature to enhance our simulationâ€™s accuracy and reliability. 
With help from our mentor Dr. Otto, we created a robust simulation model and graphs for CO2 injection wells.
Our simulator used the fundamental conservation equations to model flow behavior 
and interpolate viscosity, density, and specific heat using pressure and temperature readings from the PERTT Lab. 
We validated the simulator against commercial software and published literature to enhance accuracy and reliability. 
The project contributed to the design and optimization of CCUS wells and guided future experiments. 
We gained valuable experience in computer programming and fluid mechanics throughout the project.
